It seems to me that some classical "OOP" developers forget about the concept of composition, which should be the first pattern to consider before going with inheritance, which seems to be the de facto pattern most of the time.  By the way, Java, C#, and TypeScript all have single inheritance natively, unless you're a Toyota employee and this somehow is foreign to you.

In this repo, I have a trivial example of composition.  Why?  Well, because if you're a full-stack developer, JavaScript and TypeScript works really efficiently with composition.
